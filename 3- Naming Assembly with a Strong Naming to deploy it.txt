To deploy an assembly to the GAC: Global Assembly Cache, the assembly must be named as a strong assembly 
To name an assembly with a strong naming, the assembly must be named with pair of private and public key

The assembly files located in the properities foleder \HashTablesApp\HashTablesA\Properties
and you'll get these information in the assembly files

// General Information about an assembly is controlled through the following
// set of attributes. Change these attribute values to modify the information
// associated with an assembly.
[assembly: AssemblyTitle("HashTablesApp")]
[assembly: AssemblyDescription("")]

// Setting ComVisible to false makes the types in this assembly not visible
// to COM components.  If you need to access a type in this assembly from
// COM, set the ComVisible attribute to true on that type.
[assembly: ComVisible(false)]

// The following GUID is for the ID of the typelib if this project is exposed to COM
[assembly: Guid("0d9d7bd3-259c-4e59-b9fa-a673f5c839c3")]

// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version
//      Build Number
//      Revision

// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers
// by using the '*' as shown below:

Also we can add this line after creating the public key token, but we need to assign our application with 
a public key pair and we can generate that key in this way:
1- Use the strong key tool
2- Open the VS cmd as adminstrator 
3- use the command sn.ex -k (path to put the key like (C:\keyname.snk))// sn mean strong key and -k refers to the key pair that we want to generate 
4- add this line to the code above [assembly: AssemblyKeyFile("c:\\mySNKey.snk")]
5- Only assemblies with a strong naming could be deploy in GAC: Global Assembly Cach
